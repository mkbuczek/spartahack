# TraceNLearn:

TraceNLearn is an interactive website that is designed to help children learn and practice letter and number formation. This helps children build vocabulary and fine motor skills.

Users can draw a letter or a number on the provided canvas. This input is then processed to recognize the letter or number drawn to display immediate feedback on the box above the canvas. If letters are recognized, the box would display a formatted letter and an image that represents that same word, which starts with the drawn letter. If numbers are recognized, the box would contain the same number but formatted and an image that represents the same number of objects as the detected number.

This website will help children associate the letter or number with a corresponding word and image in order to encourage language development. By prompting the users/children to recognize the letter or number, the visual reinforcement will make learning more engaging and memorable.

TraceNLearn provides immediate feedback through fun visuals which will motivate children to keep practicing without fear of failure. Over time, it will help improve their overall speech skills in a supportive and fun way.
